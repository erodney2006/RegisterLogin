# RegisterLogin
Login page using server side back end
The idea is to have a register page use frontend and backend coding. I will use standard Html5 and javascript. The admin will be
allowed to look at the database that contains 

First Name

 Last Name

 Address1

 Address2

 City

 State

 Zip (5 or 9 digit)

 Country (US only)

these values will be stored in the database after entered in the registartion page.
